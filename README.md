4-7-8 Breathing Guide

Overview

The 4-7-8 Breathing Guide is a React-based application designed to help users practice the 4-7-8 breathing technique for relaxation and stress reduction. The app visually guides users through the cycle of inhale (4s), hold (7s), and exhale (8s) using a dynamic breathing circle animation.

Real-Time Countdown Timer – Displays the remaining time for the current phase.

Phase Transitions – Ensures the correct sequence: inhale → hold → exhale.

Pause/Resume Functionality – Allows users to pause and resume their session without restarting.

Modern UI – Styled with CSS and Framer Motion for smooth animations.
